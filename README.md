-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices, a white line appears between the main header and navbar.

## Problems Encountered During The Development Process

-   The workspace didn't recognize the command " python3 manage.py runserver."  when I did run the command pip3 freeze requirements.txt,  many installed apps were missing. To solve this problem, I copied requiremnt.txt from Github, ran the command pip3 install -r requirements.txt, migrated all data again, and created a superuser.
- During the deployment to Heroku, I accidentally pushed the secret Postgres key to GitHub respiratory **(commit hash: 5195ef10f95d45d6bbb2b30cb33a82701fdd8fde)**. I ran the git revert command to solve this, then pushed the changes. Instead of removing, the secret key I got an extra  commit **(commit hash: 1eb52d80de69417e9845e05acfd2662de32fcc41)**. In the end, I dropped the secret key and created a new one to fix the issue, but the old secret key stayed in the Git repository.

## Deployment
