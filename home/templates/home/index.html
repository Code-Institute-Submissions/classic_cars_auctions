              <p>You can do this for free on our website by registering an account.</p>
              <p>If an item you're interested in you can place a Bid, in order to buy it you'll have to bid on and
                "win".
                To
                do so, enter value into the box (your bid) and click "Place Bid."</p>
              <p>Before you decide to bid, however, there are some things you should know:</p>
              <p><strong> Our auctions accept bids only for a specific amount of time.</strong> In a traditional
                auction,
                bidders frantically place competing bids. When bidding slows to nothing, the auctioneer pounds the gavel
                and
                the item is sold. On CCA, auctions are open to bids for exactly 1 day. When time is up, the high bidder
                wins, even if people are still frantically bidding.</p>
              <p> <strong> If your bid wins, you must buy.</strong> Your bid on an auction is a legally binding
                contract.
                If, when time runs out, your bid is the highest, you have purchased the item and must pay the  for
                it.
